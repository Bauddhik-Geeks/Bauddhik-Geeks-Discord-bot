<h1>A discord bot for Bauddhik Geeks server</h>
</p>

## Should you have any questions, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/atzZYdNMDF) and ask in `#Bot`

## How to Contribute
1. Go to [Discord Developer](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a New Application
2. In that application, go to the bot tab in the sidebar and create a new bot
3. Copy the token from that bot
4. Go to the OAuth2 tab in the sidebar and click all the relevant permissions -- `bot` then `Administrator` (if you're working on your own test server, sometimes it's easier to just do `Administrator` privileges).
5. Open the URL generated and invite the bot to your preferred server.
6. Fork the [Replit](provide link here) repo.
7. Take the token you copied earlier and click the lock icon in the Replit sidebar. This should open the Secrets tab.
8. Make the key `TOKEN` and paste your token in value and then press `Add new secret`.
9. Run the bot, it should now be online!
10. Take whatever code you changed and submit a pull request! When you forked it on Replit, it should create a fork in GitHub, so by using the version control tab in the left, you can contribute.
